Technical Assessment Challenge for a position at Veeries

Statement:
"The lineup is a queue of ships expected at a port. With this information, industry agents can better plan their operations and activities. Its objective is to generate a procedure to generate a table with the expected daily volume by product,
direction (export and import) and port (Paranaguá, Santos). We limited the scope to the ports of Paranaguá and Santos and listed two potential data sources (administrations of each port):
1) https://www.appaweb.appa.pr.gov.br/appaweb/pesquisa.aspx?WCI=relLineUpRetroativo
2) https://www.portodesantos.com.br/informacoes-operacionais/operacoesportuarias/navegacao-e-movimento-de-navios/navios-esperados-carga/"
